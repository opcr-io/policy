# policy - the CLI for managing authorization policies

The policy CLI is a tool for building, versioning and publishing your authorization policies.
It uses OCI standards to manage artifacts, and the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to compile and run.

## Installation

`policy` is available on Linux, macOS and Windows platforms.

* Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available as tarballs in the [release](https://github.com/opcr-io/policy/releases) page.

* Via Homebrew for macOS or LinuxBrew for Linux

   ```shell
  brew tap opcr-io/tap && brew install opcr-io/tap/policy
   ```

  Note: if you want to try a pre-release version before the official release:

  ```shell
  brew tap opcr-io/tap && brew install opcr-io/tap/policy-rc
   ```

* Via the nix package manager on nixOS, other linux distros, and macOS

   At the moment the package is only available in the `unstable` channel. Below are some examples using nix to install `policy` via the shell, NixOS configuration, and home-manager configuration.

   Shell:
   ```shell
   nix-env --install -A nixpkgs.opcr-policy
   ```

   NixOS:
   ```nix
     # your other config ...
     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       # your other packages ...
       opcr-policy
     ];

   ```

   home-manager:
   ```nix
     # your other config ...
     home.packages = with pkgs; [
       # your other packages ...
       opcr-policy
     ];
   ```

* Via a GO install

  ```shell
  go install github.com/opcr-io/policy/cmd/policy@latest
  ```
